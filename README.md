Fun little cookbook project, I left alot of notes as to where does what in my code but it's pretty simple. Index uses htmx get requests to replace that left pane with jscript sections and regular htmx, and I took some notes from the tabs example from the HTMX page. If I was to do this again outside of a classroom setting I'd probably opt to use Flask? I wish I could've used better templating and alot of the written html comes from jscript implementations which end up feeling a bit hamfisted to me but that might be personal opinion. Anyhow, nicely functioning with a database call to 'favorite' recipes.

BY FAR happiest about the right pane persisting between loading new search content, and if I was to approach this again I'd modify the url to allow a GET request to save the viewed recipe so you could paginate between them with your back and forward history. I wasn't too sure how to go about that though, and I wanted to wrap this up to work on the other 2 papers I've got cooking haha. Overall I'm happy with it, happier than the flutter sample and about as proud of it as the ionic submission -- though it's not nearly as polished. I probably could've made something better than my React/Ionic submission if I took the full week until finals to make the site, but alas.
